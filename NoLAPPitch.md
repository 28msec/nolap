## Components, tables, Excel and OLAP

Traditionally, the set of all SEC filings is treated as a set of components. For example, a component is Coca Cola's
balance sheet for Q1 2014. Another component is the statement of income of Amazon for FY 2013.

Each of these components is a dense table with few dimensions. Typically just 2, sometimes 3 or 4.
Typically:

- one of the dimensions is the name of the reported concept (assets, revenues, etc) and there's 1 to 100 of them.
- another is the period, there are typically 1 to 4 of them.

|          | 2013 | 2014 |
|----------|------|------|
| Assets   |  1B$ | 2B$  |
| Revenues |  1M$ | 2M$  |

You can quickly calculate that, hence, a component's table typically has between 1 and 400 cells. Let's say 4,000 to account
for one or two extra dimensions.

### Excel

4,000 cells. Nothing Excel can't do.
Each one of these components can be exported in a csv format like so

| Concept  | Period | Value | Unit |
|----------|--------|-------|------|
| Assets   | 2013   | 1     | B$   |
| Assets   | 2014   | 2     | B$   |
| Revenues | 2013   | 1     | M$   |
| Revenues | 2014   | 2     | M$   |

on top of which Excel allows you to pivot,
slice and dice with these 2, 3 or 4 dimensions.

However, you're stuck in a filing. You can't compare across components, let alone across fiscal years or companies. Why?
Typically because the dimensions are different, but the names of the reported concepts can also vary even if they mean
the same thing.

### OLAP

Since it's a hypercube, this data can also be stored in an OLAP store. For example, in ROLAP, you would have a couple of
tables organized in a snowflake:

- One table with the list of concepts.
- One table with the list of periods.
- And a central table that references each of the first two, together with a value for each set of foreign keys.

## NoLAP's business value

Let's go back to the SEC filings example.

People want to compare across periods. They want to know whether Google is growing.

People want to compare across companies. They want to know whether Samsung is catching up with Apple
and when it might take over.

In order to do such comparison, you need to "merge" all the hypercubes (say, Apple's balance sheet and Samsung's balance sheet, for the years 2013 and 2014) and do something useful with this data in Excel.

### One single, big big big hypercube

With NoLAP, we go the whole way. We merge all SEC components' hypercubes to a single one. All of them.

How big is this hypercube? To give you an idea, just looking at the DOW 30 (that's barely 0.5% of the filings),
you have 811 dimensions, and in average each of these has 38 values. That's a hypercube of 38^811 cells. That's a 1 followed by like 1200 zeros. By orders of magnitude more than atoms in the universe. Of course, this hypercube is extremely sparse -- otherwise it would be physically infeasible to store it.

If you attempt to store this hypercube in a ROLAP database, you'll quickly reach limits: 811 dimension tables, and a central table with 811 columns -- with plenty of empty cells. Worse: if you want to now go ahead and import all filings, not only will be cumbersome to create new tables and migrate the central one, but this will make explode your SQL database.

### NoSQL is a perfect fit for sparseness

Somehow, sparseness marries very well with NoSQL.

1. NoSQL means heteroneous data. That's perfect: for each cell, you only need to specify the dimensions it lives in. Different cells can have different dimensions. The big hypercube is just one single NoSQL collection of heterogeneous cells.

2. NoSQL means arborescent data. That's perfect: dimension values (example: concepts) are organized in hierarchies. For example, current assets and noncurrent assets are children of assets. A hypercube's metadata, like, say, Coca Cola's balance sheet for FY 2014, can be stored in a single document. No need to join acros any tables, everything is in the document.

### On the fly hypercubes

Given one hypercube documents (see point 2 above), you can, with a single query, get all the cells and export them to Excel. In other words, you support no less than traditional approaches.

However, since these hypercubes documents are completely uncorrelated to the huge collection of cells, nothing prevents you from designing your own hypercubes, live, on the fly, and querying the fact collection.

What own hypercube? Well, for a start, let's take
1. Concepts: assets, income and revenues
2. Companies: Samsung, Apple
3. Periods: FY 2013, FY 2014

That's it. Query the big collection, get the cells, export in Excel. Here you are.
