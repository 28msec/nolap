## Business Spreadsheets The Entire Universe Won't Even Fit In
Everybody loves Excel. Tables are so nice to use and easy to understand.
But real-life data is more complex than a dense, flat table.
We support sparse, highly-dimensional spreadsheets with more cells than atoms in the visible universe.

## We hide the complexity
The look-and-feel of our spreadsheets is a familiar, Excel-like interface. We are database experts; hiding the complexity
is our job. Concentrate on what you want, not on how you can get it.

## We Follow Standards
You're free to go and take your data somewhere else, any time. Our technology is compliant with the global XBRL standard.
There's something that will prevent you from leaving us though: you won't even have to deal directly with
XBRL, and yet you'll be impressed with what we can do with XBRL that others can't.

## Know Faster Than The Market
Fiscal reports filed, say, to the SEC? Just another big spreadsheet for us. Build your own views, add your formulas in
no time. Easily compare across filings and get valuable knowledge faster than others.
